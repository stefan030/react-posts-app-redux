This is my small single page React app which consists of:

- Stateful and Stateless components
- DOM events
- Lifecycle Methods
- React routing (with Route parameters)
- Programmatic Redirects (Once we visit Contact page, it will redirect us to About after 2 seconds)
- Higher Order Components (Using Rainbow component to 'supercharge' About component - Randomize About's component text colour)
- API call using Axios
